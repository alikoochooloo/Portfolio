## Waste Project
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/wasteproject 

This project os the final project for my Database Systems class (code 307). We in association with the Westminster College environmental center, programmed an interface that accesses a database to save and display information on the physical waste produced on the Westminster College campus. We used the packeges swing from Java to build the interface and SQLite for the database. This is an important project to me because it was my first big group programming project but even more important than that is that we completed this project for a real client. This is an opportunity that most student are not even presented with. This project helped me understand the concepts and techniques of software designa and acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting.

## Math Quest
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/MathQuest 

This is a semester-long project for the software engineering class. We built an math adventure game for second graders where the player can explore an open-world map and complete different basic math questions designed for second graders. We used GML (Game Maker Language) to build the game using GameMake Studion2 developed by Yoyo games. This project imporved my back-end development skills because of many challenges this project presented to the group as a whole like communication, lack of many resources to help us, and many problems with source control. This projects helped me acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting, develop effective problem solving skills, and understand the concepts and techniques of software design.

## Senior Project, Spoken Language Indentification
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/senior-project

This is a project that took me one semester to prepare for and another semester to program. It is by far and away my biggets project to this day and I am very proud of it. On its face it is just a simple python GUI developed using kivy library. But the backend code is a machine learning convolutional neural network algorithm that took me alot of time and effort to create. The algorithm is a 4 layer 1-dimenssional model that it is designed to destinct between English, Russian, and Chinese using a 4-second audio as an input. The model itself has a taining accuracy of 99.6% and testing accuracy of 99.1%. The data for this project was downloaded from the website VoxForge which is a dataset of people donating their voice while talking in their language.
