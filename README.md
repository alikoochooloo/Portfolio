portfolio of the my major projects

## Waste Project
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/wasteproject 

This project os the final project for my Database Systems class (code 307). We in association with the Westminster College environmental center, programmed an interface that accesses a database to save and display information on the physical waste produced on the Westminster College campus. We used the packeges swing from Java to build the interface and SQLite for the database. This is an important project to me because it was my first big group programming project but even more important than that is that we completed this project for a real client. This is an opportunity that most student are not even presented with. This project helped me understand the concepts and techniques of software designa and acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting.

## Math Quest
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/MathQuest 

This is a semester-long project for the software engineering class. We built an math adventure game for second graders where the player can explore an open-world map and complete different basic math questions designed for second graders. We used GML (Game Maker Language) to build the game using GameMake Studion2 developed by Yoyo games. This project imporved my back-end development skills because of many challenges this project presented to the group as a whole like communication, lack of many resources to help us, and many problems with source control. This projects helped me acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting, develop effective problem solving skills, and understand the concepts and techniques of software design.

## Senior Project, Spoken Language Indentification
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/senior-project

This is an individual project that took me one semester to prepare for and another semester to program. It is by far and away my biggets project to this day and I am very proud of it. On its face it is just a simple python GUI developed using kivy library. But the backend code is a machine learning convolutional neural network algorithm that took me alot of time and effort to create. The algorithm is a 4 layer 1-dimenssional model that it is designed to destinct between English, Russian, and Chinese using a 4-second audio as an input. The model itself has a taining accuracy of 99.6% and testing accuracy of 99.1%. The data for this project was downloaded from the website VoxForge which is a dataset of people donating their voice while talking in their language.

## Sleeping TA
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/SleepingTA

This project is a set codes written in C. the premiss of the project is to learn how to use semaphores and mutex locks in C. This assignment helped me by growing my knowledge of basic level computer operating systems functionalities as well as the use of header files when programming in C. it is a set of programs that call upon each other. simply put, this project simulates how a TA helps 5 students that are working but every once in a while have to get help but only one at a time and there are only 3 chares available for students to wait for the TA.

## ChatShack project
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/ChatShack

this is a project done with another classmate, creating a Java based GUI as the front end and a chat server as the backend that allows devices within one network to connect to each other with different usernames and chat using the user interface. People are allowed to send messeges to the group or to individual people. we had to create a class wide protocol for the chat server with other groups to ensure our servers and clients could run on each others. although we all got the basics of the protocol right, there were details in the protocol that were upto each persons interpretation.

## A-star implementation 
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/maze-astar

this assignment was one of the hardest and most important ones I had in my Algorithms class. this code creates a big maze and lets a red dot find its way out. the algorithm for the red dot is A-star. the red dot waits, calculates its next step, and takes the best one relative to the exit position. this assignment is incredibly important because I let me implement one of the most used algorithms known by myself and learn valuable lessons from it.
