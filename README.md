## Waste Project
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/wasteproject 

This project os the final project for my Database Systems class (code 307). We in association with the Westminster College environmental center, programmed an interface that accesses a database to save and display information on the physical waste produced on the Westminster College campus. We used the packeges swing from Java to build the interface and SQLite for the database. This is an important project to me because it was my first big group programming project but even more important than that is that we completed this project for a real client. This is an opportunity that most student are not even presented with. This project helped me understand the concepts and techniques of software designa and acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting.

## Math Quest
https://github.com/alikoochooloo/MathQuest 

This is a semester-long project for the software engineering class and it is by far and away my biggets project to this day. We built an math adventure game for second graders where the player can explore an open-world map and complete different basic math questions designed for second graders. We used GML (Game Maker Language) to build the game using GameMake Studion2 developed by Yoyo games. This project imporved my back-end development skills because of many challenges this project presented to the group as a whole like communication, lack of many resources to help us, and many problems with source control. This projects helped me acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting, develop effective problem solving skills, and understand the concepts and techniques of software design.
